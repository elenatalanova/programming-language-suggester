# Independent Project of week 2, Jan 15 2021

### _By Elena Talanova_

## JavaScript and jQuery program

### Technology Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Description

This is supposed to be a project where I demonstrate my JavaScript knowlege and basically it is the one. Because the absence of knowledge is also an indicator that can be easily graded. Way too easily I would say:) But if to be serious, my JavaScript code isn't working and I have no idea why! I've spent entire two days rereading the school material and googling, but couldn't figure it out anyway. So frustrating. I need your help!
