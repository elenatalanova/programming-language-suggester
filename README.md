## Description

This is supposed to be a project where I demonstrate my JavaScript knowlege and basically it is the one. Because the abcence of knowledge is also an indicator that can be easily grade. Way too easily i would say:)
But if to be serious, my JavaScript code does not work and I have no idea why! I've spent two day rereading the school material and googling, but no results to fix it. So frustrating. I need your help!
